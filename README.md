### What is it?
*My final solo project for Coding Dojo. But more importantly it's...*  
An organizational tool for artists and creators to consolidate commission orders into a single place.

Users can register with the site to have the functionality of both creators and clients.
Creators can create queues with clients to converse, upload images and track status of an order.
Clients can respond to updates with approval of new changes or request edits to be made.
Creators can mark queues as complete and sort existing queues by various attributes.
